# Promptulate

1. You'll be working entirely in `calc-you-later.js`. Don't touch anywhere else!
2. Take in the user's input through the browser's prompt method. You'll most likely have to do some research here!
3. The user's input will come in as a string, but we want to separate it into each component part. We should expect the user's input to come in in the format of [operation] [number1] [number2], e.g. "+ 3 5". 
4. Now give those values to our `calculate` function.
5. And put that result on the DOM. Check out the html for an answer.
